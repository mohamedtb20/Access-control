suppose an application robustly enforces access control over the main administrative page at /admin, but for sub-pages such as /admin/deleteUser only inspects the Referer header. 
If the Referer header contains the main /admin URL, then the request is allowed.

it means that you can access to sensitive data through other user referer header
