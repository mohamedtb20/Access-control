If a web site uses rigorous front-end controls to restrict access based on URL,
 but the application allows the URL to be overridden via a request header, 
 then it might be possible to bypass the access controls using a request with the non-stantard http headers 

 steps :
 1-send the /admin request to burpsuite reapeter 
 2-add the X-Original-URL : /admin
 3-you will see 200k response with the details : delete , usernames ...
 4-you add the /delete to the header : X-Original-URL : /admin/delete
 5-add the /?username=carlos to the get reqest to get only the username and the url from the header
